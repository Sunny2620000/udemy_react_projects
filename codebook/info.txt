Resource which i have used in this project 
Resource 1 :- tailwaild css install 
command npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

and after that i have created a tailwaild config file in the root of project and added some css in main css file of this project like App.css

if tailwaild css is not reflecting in the project we should have to clear cache from the project by using this command 
npm cache clear --force
Resource 2: react router dom
command npm i react-router-dom


Resource 3: json server
command :- npm i json-server
it is getting a full fake REST-API with zero coding 

run server :- json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

i have created a data folder inside this folder i have stored our json data while those data i will be use in the whole project..


Resource 4: json server auth
command : - npm i json-server-auth 
JWT authentication middleware for JSON Server

Because you also need a fake authentication & authorization flow for your prototyping.

but json server auth is not working we need to work on it

Resource 5:react-notify-toastr
command :-$ npm install --save react-toastify

for toast message
